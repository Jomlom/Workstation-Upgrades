- Reinforced Furnace
  - Sometimes, the inventory GUI will temporarily deysnc and show a duplicate of an item stack - this is purley visual and the duplicate stack will quickly disappear

## About

Workstation Upgrades is a simple WIP mod that adds upgraded workstation blocks in Minecraft. Starting with the Reinforced Furnace, this mod aims to add upgradability to the boring and outdated vanilla workstations.\
<br>

### Future Plans

This mod only introduces one block so far, which still has some issues. I have just started learning to program mods and hope to iron these out soon and start on some new blocks.
For example, an upgraded crafting table which can access nearby chests for crafting!
